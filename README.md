# Unity 2D Platformer
## This is a simple 2D Platformer example for Programmer Task for people to use as a template or reference.

### Using Unity version 2020.3.17f1 LTS

This project contains a sprite with simple movement with animations and platform. Displays GameOver menu with restart button when reach the end of the platform.

If you don't want to use git, here's the zip file containing the same project [release](https://github.com/UML-GameDev/Task-2D-Platformer/releases/tag/v1.0)
tho if you are programmer, I highly recommend you to learn how to use git and GitHub.
